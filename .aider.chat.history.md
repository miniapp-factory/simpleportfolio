#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this new file to describe the logo image that should be generated.  

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create the new `logo.png.todo` file.

A stylized logo featuring a simple, modern representation of a cryptocurrency portfolio. The logo shows a stylized bar chart with three bars of varying heights, each bar colored in a gradient of green to blue, set against a clean white background. Above the chart, the app name 'Simple Portfolio Value Tracker' is written in a bold, sans-serif font. The overall design is minimalistic and conveys the idea of tracking portfolio value.
